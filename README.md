# Firefly

# Description

Firefly is an open-source software-hardware project which is basically a night-light.

The night-light's source of light is a single [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) [LED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode).

The LED is controlled by the [Arduion Pro Mini](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardProMini) microcontroller. The Arduino is powered with an [nine-volt battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-volt_battery).

The communication with the remote control device is established over the [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) connection. The Bluetooth module used by the Firefly is the [JY-MCU](http://reprap.org/wiki/Jy-mcu).

The remote control device software is written in [QML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QML) and may run on a variety of devices from moboile phones to personal computers.
